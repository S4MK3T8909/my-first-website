<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>I’ve always had a quiet love for drawing specially drawing peoples portraits.I would say I am not great at it but 
I make a decent portrait.drawing helps me express things I can’t always put into words.I also doodle alot if you see 
my textbooks you would understand what I mean.Drawing is just something I do for fun. </p>
